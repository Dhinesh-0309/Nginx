How This Project Helps Microservices Applications!

Building this project is like running a food delivery app. Imagine:

Traffic Manager (Nginx): All customer orders (requests) come through a single counter (Nginx). The counter knows which kitchen (microservice) should handle pizzas, drinks, or desserts.
Load Balancer: If one kitchen is too busy, the counter sends orders to another. No waiting, no angry customers — just smooth service!
SSL Security: It’s like securing the delivery vans with locks (HTTPS). Even if someone tries to peek, your order details are safe.
